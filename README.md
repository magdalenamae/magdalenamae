# **👋 Hi, I’m Magdalena**

I’m a Software Engineer with ~3 years of experience, growing from junior to senior while working across projects that touch many parts of a business. I focus on building reliable, scalable software and enjoy turning unclear requirements into practical solutions.

**🚀 What I work with**

- Languages & Frameworks: Python, Django, React, TypeScript, Bash, HTMX
- Databases & Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, AWS, Linux, server setup & maintenance
- APIs: Designing, building, and consuming REST/OpenAPI-based APIs
- Other: Object-oriented design patterns, CI/CD pipelines, cross-team collaboration

**💡 What makes me different**

- I started my career running my own business and managing high-end fine dining restaurants in Melbourne. That background gave me strong skills in people management, conflict resolution, and thriving under pressure — strengths I now bring into engineering.
- I’ve progressed quickly from junior → a fully fledged engineer, trusted as the only remote team member in my role, and given the opportunity to mentor others while helping manage external development vendors to reduce project costs.
- Outside of coding, I’m passionate about health and fitness (currently training toward a bodybuilding competition 🏋️‍♀️), exploring Queensland’s coast and bushwalks 🌿, and working on my own side projects, including developing games.

**🔭 What I’m up to**

- Learning more about optimisation and large-scale problem solving
- Expanding my experience with cloud infrastructure and distributed systems
- Building personal projects to sharpen my skills and explore new tech
